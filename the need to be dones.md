# if the server (backend) restarts or closes with an incomplite orders then on the next start up i want it to go though the admins channel and find incomplite orders and send a notification saying id #### delivery wasnt complite would u like to re-order this order 1.if admin clicks yes (there is a yes no button) then send the admins channel a message of the full info of the order and tell them to make sure if the order is complite 
#  also i have seen if somone clicks /order it automatically goes in to the order catagory fix that 
# also need to edit the /clearorders button more prosisly 
# fix the location problem it needs work
# fix, the bot dosent collect info from the admin channel ... info like the admin location




#i need to add an amharic version an ask user what language user prefers

# on the admin side when orders pile up its hard to know wich orders are incomplite because the bot keeps updating the maps and the order gets barried under a lot of location updates

# right after the order is complite i want the bot to delete the prompted messages from the user and have a clear page

# user should be able to order multiple orders at once 

# Add the owners account 1000688588972 for her and 1000466307371 for kal
